Laptop price prediction is a machine learning task that involves developing models to predict the price of laptops based on various features such as specifications, brand, model, and other factors. This prediction is valuable for both consumers and sellers in making informed decisions. Machine learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks can be employed to build predictive models from historical data. These models learn the relationships between input features and laptop prices and can be used to predict the price of unseen laptops. The accuracy of the predictions depends on the quality and relevance of the features used, as well as the performance of the chosen machine learning algorithm. Overall, laptop price prediction can help users make informed purchasing decisions and assist sellers in setting competitive prices in the market.
